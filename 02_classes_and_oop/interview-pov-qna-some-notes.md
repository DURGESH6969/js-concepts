Most Important Note - "Everything in javascript happens inside an Execution Context"

Explaination - Execution context is like a big box . It has two component, the first one is memory component - it is the place where all the variables and functions are stored as key value pair ex - const a = 10; will be stored like this a : 10, functions are also stored inside this memory component. Memory component is also known as Variable Enviroment.

// The second component of the execution context is the code component. In  this code component, every single line of code is executed one line at a time. This code component is also known as Thread of Execution.
